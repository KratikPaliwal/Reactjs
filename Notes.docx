React always use bundler to improve syntax and to upgrade syntax




Hooks in Reacts :
1. useState :
    let [varible_name, function_name]=useState(0);
    jaha jaha webpage pe wo varible hota hai wo ek sath change ho jata hai.


To update Virtual DOM react uses fibre algorithm

Fibre algorithm  uses incremental rendering : means the ability to split render into chunks matlab jaha change karna hai woh hi tree ki branch pe ja kar change karta hai aur koi koi iteration ko skip bhi kar deta hai aur fat change ho toh 
 

 Some important features are : 
It can pause, abort and reuse work as the new update come and 
has ability to assign the priority to different updates.

Jab tak javascript inject hota tha wo process ko Hydration bolte.
Fibre algorithm ke through Hydration process aache se hoti hai 


Reconciliation is the algorithm behind the Virtual DOM

What we can do in fibre algorithm are : 
pause work and come back to it later
assign priority to different types of work
reuse previous completed work
abort work if it's no longer needed



UseState if we increase the counter by like this setCounter(counter+1)
setCounter(counter+1)
setCounter(counter+1)
setCounter(counter+1)

So it will not increase the counter value to 4 directly beacause react take as a bundle and it is performing same thing so it will do it increase value only one time

to increase the value directly by 4 we have to use a callback function which will give previous value of the counter 


setCounter(prevcounter => prevcounter+1)
